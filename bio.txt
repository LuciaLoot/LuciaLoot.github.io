<strong>Lucia Loot doesn't like fitting in one little box.</strong> The 22 year-old transfeminine music producer based in Paris, raised in Bordeaux, brings <strong>melancholy-infused hyperpop</strong> in her latest project '<strong>AVANT ENCORE</strong>'. Blending influences ranging from <strong>glitch music, dubstep, D&B, house music, UK garage, alternative rock, and psychedelic rock</strong>, her productions never quite fit in one category, whether it's in her solo projects, with her bandmates from '<strong>Hummingbirds from Saturdays<strong/>' or '<strong>Singing Loudly About Yolande<strong/>', or in her productions for other artists. <br><br>
Being the technical and artistic "swiss knife" that she is, she is also a <strong>part-time graphic designer, amateur video editor, 3D hobbyist<strong/>, and president of her own record label, '<strong>Big Piaf Music<strong/>'.
